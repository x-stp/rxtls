# Security Policy

We care about keeping `rxtls` and its users secure. Even though this is a small Go project, security reports are taken seriously.

Our goal is to leave the ecosystem better (and safer) than we found it. We will never knowingly introduce vulnerabilities and we appreciate all responsible disclosure efforts.
