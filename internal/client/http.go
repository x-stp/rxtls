/*
Package client provides a configurable HTTP client for making requests to Certificate Transparency logs and other services.
It includes support for connection pooling, timeouts, and a "turbo" mode for aggressive, high-throughput scenarios.

The package manages a shared global HTTP client instance that can be configured once and then retrieved by multiple
parts of the application. This promotes reuse of TCP connections and consistent client behavior.
