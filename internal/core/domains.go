// This file previously contained logic for the 'domains' command.
// That logic is now implemented via the DomainExtractor type in domain_extractor.go
// and invoked from cmd/rxtls/main.go.
// This file remains for potential future core utilities related to domains,
// but the old functions (ExtractDomains, processDomains, etc.) have been removed.
