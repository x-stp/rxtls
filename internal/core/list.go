// ListCTLogs retrieves the list of available Certificate Transparency (CT) logs.
// It serves as a simple wrapper around `certlib.GetCTLogs`, which encapsulates the logic
// for fetching the log list either from a remote source (e.g., Google's JSON list) or
// from a local file cache, depending on the `certlib.UseLocalLogs` global setting.
//
// This function is primarily used by command-line interface (CLI) commands that need to
// display available logs or allow users to select logs for processing.
//
// Performance Note: This function itself does not perform detailed STH (Signed Tree Head)
// fetching for each log to determine its size or state, as that would be too slow for
// a simple listing operation. The `certlib.GetCTLogs` function focuses on retrieving the
// basic log metadata (URL, description, operator).
//
// Returns:
//   - A slice of `certlib.CTLogInfo` structs, each representing a known CT log.
//   - An error if retrieving or parsing the log list fails.
